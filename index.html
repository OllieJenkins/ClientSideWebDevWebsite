          <p>Client side scripting is when a scripting language runs its functionality on the user's PC through their web browser rather than the server running the website. Server side scripting happens where the website is hosted directly on the server, the opposite of client side scripting. People who host web servers tend to run the most demanding scripts on the client’s PC, this is due to the fact that the client’s PC is a much faster system. Since servers are designed to just run a huge amount of data on the internet, and if you’re using a shared server design, running scripts on the user’s PC is a huge advantage.

Client side and server side scripting have different scripting environments which they run on, obviously client side scripting is ran on the web browser itself and works with the HTML code. While server side scripting is designed to run on a web server environment, and might even use a whole different scripting language altogether.


Client side has a few advantages over server side scripting, especially for the goal of making interactive web pages and interactive gadgets or applets. First the system that client side scripting will be running on is most of the time going to be a lot faster than the server. This means any client side scripting will run significantly faster than server side scripting and allows for fast web page loading. It also means the interactivity will not be hindered, as for server side scripting, it might actually slow down interactive elements of the web page.


Server side scripting is mostly used for communicating with databases and retrieving information on the user. Things like e-commerce, social networks, security, privacy and data keeping will be used for server side scripting, as servers can handle huge amounts of data. Which is where client side scripting can fall short, but since interactivity and web page presentation does not depend on huge amounts of data, it does not need that sort of power.
Client side scripting is a lot more advantageous to use against server side scripting for interactivity of web pages. Simply due to the fact that the computer running the said script will be faster, which also in turn relieves a huge amount of stress on the server side scripting. Which means it allows for the server side scripting to deal with more specific situations to do with databases and security.


Client side scripting is a huge advantage for basic user experience and interaction with the web page, it is extremely useful since it is used mainly for interaction and the design of the web page. User experience in this day and age depends heavily on the usage of client side scripting, things like drop-down boxes would not be even possible without the usage of client side scripting.
Before scripting, things were extremely basic as web sites only used HTML and CSS, there weren’t any forms or animations of any sort, nor were there any drop-down boxes. Client side scripting is extremely important because it saves the user time, and makes your web page easier to navigate, and provides visual benefits in making your design more appealing and understandable. 
Client side scripting also forwarded the increase in security on the World Wide Web and has provided a huge array of benefits for the user. Form validation refers to forms returning messages based on what the user has inputted into the form’s text boxes, the form information can even be compared to a database. However simple things like checking if a form has actually been filled out or not can be done on a client side scripting language like JavaScript.
In conclusion, client side scripting has improved the user accessibility of the web, and has enabled people to have a better understanding of the web pages they view. It has made web pages evolve in the way they look, the way they function and the way they handle information from a data base. It has also improved the loading speeds of web pages tremendously over the course of the evolution of client side scripting. Client side scripting and Server side scripting are both required for a functioning website, but for interactivity and form validation, client side scripting is imperative.
