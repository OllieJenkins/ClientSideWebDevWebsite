Inline CSS adds styling to a single HTML element by using an attribute of an element called style, this could be an advantage for a specific page to have a different CSS to most, 
although if you use inline CSS then it must be applied to each of the HTML 
elements and can take a lot of time. <br><br><br><br></p>

          <h2>Scripting Languages</h2>
          <p><br>
            The purpose of a scripting language is to allow users to interact with the computer. As computers only 
understand machine code which is very hard for the user to understand or even comprehend, a scripting language acts like the barrier that connects users to the computer and allows them to control them in the way they want. Scripting languages like python and JavaScript are also fairly simple to learn and code, making the barrier between user and computer much shorter.<br><br>

Typical uses of scripts in web pages include validation, forms and to enhance the user experience on the web page. Scripts can be created to make forms that prompt the user for input that is required. Scripts can also be made and linked to these forms to validate the user input to make sure that what the user has entered into the text fields matches certain criteria and that the user has filled it out to the best of their ability. This is called client side validation and is significantly faster than sending the data to the server to be validated and then sent back.<br><br> 

Event driven programs are programs in which the 
instructions flow are controlled by user events, such as mouse clicking. However, by having different event driven programs, responding to individual events, this will lower response time. An event handler will typically communicate the completion of a task to the program.<br><br> 

Object orientated programs are a set of instructions which allow different objects to communicate with each other. The objects will communicate with each other in order to achieve the ultimate instruction set by the user. Objects can inherit characteristics from other objects to create relationships between them.<br><br>

                In CSS, the term box model is used when talking about design and layout of the HTML webpage, this consists of margin, padding, border and content. The CSS box model is fundamentally a box that forms around HTML elements, which allows you to display content on your 
website. The box model is a set of standards for how web browsers will display the content on a page.<br><br> </p>

 The margin is the furthest edge of the box. It is transparent and 
displays space between the 
element and other box model parts on the page. 
The border is the next box model term surrounding the box. Borders can be colored or transparent.  
Borders can be used for decorative purposes, and distinctively displays the webpage.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

  The padding is the space between the content and the border. 
Padding is the same color as the background color for the box. 
Similar to the border, if the padding is set to 0, the padding border is the same as the next box model term, the content. 

The content is where the main 
information, pictures and videos go.<br><br><br></p>

 ID selectors allow you to set the style format of your elements within your web page. They are used for specific styles for one unique element and are known by using a hast tag (#). 
Class Selectors allow you to set a specific type of style for several 
different HTML elements. The Class 
selectors are known by using a dot (.) before the code.<br><br></p>

            The file, style.css is an external file that is located in the same working directory as the index.html file. To import (load) it into the document namespace we use the HTML <link> element, which is used exclusively in the &lt;head>&lt;/head> element.<br><br>
              
              For example:<br>
              &lt;link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/><br><br>
              
The HEAD of the document is where all the METADATA is imported. This data is for the browser, not the end user. A style sheet is a form of metadata.<br><br>

The three attributes are href;<br>
The h stands for hypertext and the ref stands for reference. It refers to a resource location or URL. The href is always a URL to an external resource, external meaning separate from the document html file. It can be anywhere on the network, local volume, another computer, a web server or content delivery network.<br><br>

type<br>
This tells the browser the MIME Type of the file so it knows how to parse it into the DOM.<br><br>

rel<br>
This stands for relation. The attribute tells the user agent what relation this resource has to the document.

              There are three different ways of making CSS selections on a webpage to change certain elements. These are tag Selection, ID Selection and class Selection. These different ways of applying CSS rules would be used in different scenarios depending on what the designer is looking to do.<br><br></div></p>
          <div class="box2">
<p>
Tag selection  is where the CSS is applied to any HTML element which matches the CSS selection rule. For example if you wanted to change all h2 tags to grey, you would use a tag selection because the rule would then be applied to any piece of HTML surrounded by a h2 tag. Tag selectors can be overridden by more specific rules applied using either ID or class selection, therefore you could use tag selection to put down a basic styling of the webpage. You could then use more specific rules to further style them when needed. For this reason, tag element selection would be good for putting together the house style of the website such as the font colour, family and size. HTML elements are nested which means that if a rule is applied to the body tag, it will also affect the paragraphs so can be used to change the font family of the entire web page at once.<br><br>
Example code – applying to an address tag:<br>

address { color: gray; }<br><br>
              
              ID selection is the next method of selecting specific parts of a webpage to style is to use the element's ID attribute. This is done using the # symbol, followed by the ID of the element. The desired CSS rules then follow. An ID attribute is unique to a page (each element should have a different ID name) and so would normally be used for styling only one specific HTML element – this makes ID selection a good alternative to inline styling. ID selection also works well with JavaScript when being used to change the CSS of a webpage after it has been loaded by the browser. This is because JavaScript has the getDocumentByElementId command which can then be used to alter the existing CSS on the page. Whereas JavaScript’s getElementByClassName isn’t universally recognised by all browsers meaning it can’t be relied upon to change CSS. Another reason to use ID selection over class and tag selection is that it has the higher precedence, this means that ID selection can be used to override any rules created with classes or tags for a specific case.<br><br>
              
              Example Code – applying to a p tag with id “someStyling”:<br>

#someStyling {
    color: red;
}<br><br>

CSS can also be applied to pages using the class names of each HTML element this is called class selection. It is implemented in a CSS file by typing a . followed by the class name and then any rules that apply to it. One HTML tag can have many classes assigned to it which can then be used to add more rules to an element. For example a division may have a class of panel which gives it a border. It may also then have panel-primary added to it on top which would change the border to blue. Therefore class selections would be used to change the style of more than one element without affecting them all. Class selections can also be used to override the styles set by tag selections. Therefore classes would be used for CSS when a tag selection needs be overridden.<br><br>
Example code – applied to classes “panel” & “panel-primary”<br>

.panel {<br>
    border-radius: 5px; 
}<br>
.panel-primary {<br>
    border-color: blue;
}

          <p><br> Client side scripting is when a scripting language runs its functionality on the user's PC through their web browser rather than the server running the website. Server side scripting happens where the website is hosted directly on the server, the opposite of client side scripting. People who host web servers tend to run the most demanding scripts on the client’s PC, this is due to the fact that the client’s PC is a much faster system. Since servers are designed to just run a huge amount of data on the internet, and if you’re using a shared server design, running scripts on the user’s PC is a huge advantage.<br><br>

Client side and server side scripting have different scripting environments which they run on, obviously client side scripting is ran on the web browser itself and works with the HTML code. While server side scripting is designed to run on a web server environment, and might even use a whole different scripting language altogether.<br><br>


Client side has a few advantages over server side scripting, especially for the goal of making interactive web pages and interactive gadgets or applets. First the system that client side scripting will be running on is most of the time going to be a lot faster than the server. This means any client side scripting will run significantly faster than server side scripting and allows for fast web page loading. It also means the interactivity will not be hindered, as for server side scripting, it might actually slow down interactive elements of the web page.<br><br>


Server side scripting is mostly used for communicating with databases and retrieving information on the user. Things like e-commerce, social networks, security, privacy and data keeping will be used for server side scripting, as servers can handle huge amounts of data. Which is where client side scripting can fall short, but since interactivity and web page presentation does not depend on huge amounts of data, it does not need that sort of power.<br><br>
              
Client side scripting is a lot more advantageous to use against server side scripting for interactivity of web pages. Simply due to the fact that the computer running the said script will be faster, which also in turn relieves a huge amount of stress on the server side scripting. Which means it allows for the server side scripting to deal with more specific situations to do with databases and security. Client side scripting is a huge advantage for basic user experience and interaction with the web page, it is extremely useful since it is used mainly for interaction and the design of the web page. User experience in this day and age depends heavily on the usage of client side scripting, things like drop-down boxes would not be even possible without the usage of client side scripting.<br><br>
              
Before scripting, things were extremely basic as web sites only used HTML and CSS, there weren’t any forms or animations of any sort, nor were there any drop-down boxes. Client side scripting is extremely important because it saves the user time, and makes your web page easier to navigate, and provides visual benefits in making your design more appealing and understandable. Client side scripting also forwarded the increase in security on the World Wide Web and has provided a huge array of benefits for the user. Form validation refers to forms returning messages based on what the user has inputted into the form’s text boxes, the form information can even be compared to a database. However simple things like checking if a form has actually been filled out or not can be done on a client side scripting language like JavaScript.<br><br>

              In conclusion, client side scripting has improved the user accessibility of the web, and has enabled people to have a better understanding of the web pages they view. It has made web pages evolve in the way they look, the way they function and the way they handle information from a data base. It has also improved the loading speeds of web pages tremendously over the course of the evolution of client side scripting. Client side scripting and Server side scripting are both required for a functioning website, but for interactivity and form validation, client side scripting is imperative.

            There are many different browsers in use today by website visitors. Some of the most popular ones being used today include: Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari. However because of the way each browser renders web content there can be some difference in the way the same piece of code is run in two different browsers. This is why it is so important to test a website in multiple browsers.</p><br><br></div>

Browser detection can be used to see which features of JavaScript a certain browser can handle. For example some of the older browsers, such as Firefox 3, don’t support the newer features of JavaScript. Therefore a developer will know to avoid trying to use these features if this browser check as returned Firefox 3 as the browser being used. This means that newer browsers get the additional features available in JavaScript but the website is still compatible in older browsers.</p><br><br></div>
     <div class="box">
            <p><br>        
Another way of seeing which JavaScript functions are available in the current browser is using object detection. This checks to see whether the object needed to run a certain function is available. For instance the random function in JavaScript is reliant on the Math class.</p><br><br><br></div>
       <div class="box2">
            <p><br>       
This method of feature detection is better than simply detecting the browser name because a feature may be incompatible with many different browsers. By using object detection, you can just run one check before using a JavaScript function. With browser detection you would need to run a check for every incompatible browser which would take more time to run and execute.
There are also a few differences between browsers in the way that the JavaScript engine interprets scripts. For example glitches are present in Internet Explorer that aren’t in other browsers, these need to be taken into account when making client side scripts. One of those glitches is that when making an array, all browsers are fine with a trailing comma after the last element except Internet Explorer. <br><br>
